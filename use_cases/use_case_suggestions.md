# Suggestions for use cases

+ **Log in**

  We need to make sure this works even if two-factor authentication is activated and that we avoid storing the password if 
  at all possible. We also need a way to store the session so the user does not need to login every time the application is 
  restarted. (Should be possible to do without storing the user password by 
  [saving the AppState](https://www.npmjs.com/package/facebook-chat-api#saving-session).)
